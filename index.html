        Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the solar system. Its orbital 
        period around the Sun of 87.67 days is the shortest of all the planets in the 
        Solar System. It is named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the 
        gods.

        Did you know: Mercury is made of about 70% metallic and 30% silicate
                      material.

    <!--
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 224.7 Earth days.
        it has the longest rotation period of any planet in the Solar System and 
        rotates in the opposite direction that most other planets. It does not have
        any natural satellites. It is named after the Roman goddes of love and beauty.
        
        Did you know: On Venus, volcanoes are mainly of the shield type.

        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object
        known to harbor life. According to radiomatic dating and other sources of
        evidence. Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts
        with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only 
        natural satellite.

        Did you know: Earth has an atmosphere made up of many gases.

    <!--
        Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second smallest planet in the
        Solar System after Mercury.

        Did you know: The Viking 1 orbiter operated and imaged Mars for 5 years.

    <!--
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar Syatem.
        It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but tow-and-
        half times that of all other planets in the Solar Syatem combined.

        Did you know: It would have to be 80 times more massive.
    -->

    <!--
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar
        System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine 
        times that of the Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth,
        but with its larger volume Saturn is over 95 times more massive.

        Did you know: Galileo Galilei was the first ever person to look at Satrurn 
                      using a telescope in 1610.
    -->

    <!--
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary
        radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is'
        similar in compositions which differ from that of larger gas giants Jupiter
        and Saturn.

        Did you know: The climatic conditions of Uranus are extreme.
    -->

    <!--
        Neptune is the eightth and the farthest known planet from the Sun in the Solar 
        System. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
        the third-most massive planet, and the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17
        times the mass of the Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin
        Uranus.

        Did you know: A planet must orbit the Sun, which Neptune does - once every 165 years.
    -->

    <!--
        Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies betond Neptune.
        It was the first Kuiper belt object to be discovered and is the largest known
        plutoid. Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally 
        considered as the ninth planet from the Sun.

        Did you know: Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is mainly made of rock
                      and ice.
